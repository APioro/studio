        <b>PROJECT GOAL</b>
        <br><br>
        Moonbun is a self-initiated branding project for a coffee shop with a dark, magical atmosphere. The concept centers on blending a cozy, ritualistic coffee experience with mysterious and whimsical elements. The visual identity needed to feel both inviting and enchanting, appealing to customers who appreciate an immersive, unique café vibe. The goal was to create a brand that stands out in a saturated market by combining mood, storytelling, and elegance.

         <b>DESIGN SOLUTIONS</b>
        <br><br>
        The brand’s objective was to create an enchanted yet approachable character. This was achieved through a monochromatic palette with a dominant dark tone, balancing mystery with warmth. The logo features a playful yet enigmatic rabbit in a cup, symbolizing both comfort and magic. Serif typography with gothic details adds distinct personality and sets the brand apart from typical minimalist coffee shops. The website imagery draws from vintage café culture—featuring copper coffee makers, worn books, and aged wooden tables—to convey a sense of history, craftsmanship, and local charm.
