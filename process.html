                <div class="process-text-white">
                    Once you’ve reached out through my booking form, I’ll be in touch to arrange a call if the project feels like a good fit. 
                    This is our chance to meet, chat, and set the stage for our creative journey together.
                    <br><br>
                    During the call, my focus is on really listening — getting to know your goals, your audience, and the “why” behind your project.
                    I’ll guide the conversation with questions, but it’s really just an open, relaxed space to share your vision.
                    <br><br>
                    After our call, I’ll create a clear proposal that lays out the scope of work, the deliverables, and the investment. If everything feels right, I’ll send over the agreement and deposit invoice — and then we’re ready to get moving.

                <div class="process-text">
                    Depending on the package you choose, this stage may include a full Strategy Session. This is where we dive beneath the surface and uncover the personality of your brand — exploring archetypes, values, audience motivations, and the bigger story you want to tell.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s especially powerful for new businesses who want a strong foundation before launching, or for growing brands that feel a little lost and need clarity before refreshing their identity.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on our strategy work, I’ll research design directions that align with your goals and create 2–3 moodboards. Each board sets out a different “world” your brand could live in — showing mood, typography, color palette, and layout style.

                <div class="process-text-white">
                    Once we have picked the most suitable direction, I will brainstorm, sketch, and explore a wide range of possibilities.
                    I’ll develop logo concepts, refine typography, explore color palettes, and build out supporting elements that bring your brand personality to life. 
                    <br><br>
                    Every choice — from the curve of a letter to the tone of a color — connects back to your objectives and the audience we defined earlier. By the end, we have refined design directions that aren’t just beautiful, but also purposeful and aligned with your long-term goals.

                <div class="process-text">
                    Once the design is ready, I’ll prepare a clear presentation for you. Instead of just sending over files, I show you how each concept works in context — on mockups, applications, and touchpoints that make it easy to imagine your brand in the real world.
                    <br><br>
                    Each concept comes with an explanation of the thinking behind it, so you understand not only what it looks like, but why it was designed that way.

                    Depending on your package, this usually includes 1–2 rounds of feedback and adjustments. In case any changes need to be made, we will disccuss them to make sure you are happy with the outcome.
                    <br><br>
                    By the end of this stage, you’ll have a design that feels confident, professional, and fully aligned with your strategy. I will deliver the filles neatly organized together with simple guidliness. If at any times you need help with using your brand feel free to contact me. I am to establish a long-term relationship with my clients.
