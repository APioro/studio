        <b>PROJECT GOAL</b>
        <br><br>
       The foundation needed a branding system that would reflect inclusivity, optimism, and authenticity. Their previous identity felt unclear and inconsistent, lacking the warmth and energy that represented their mission. The challenge was to create a visual language that could both respect the seriousness of their work and radiate the joy and creativity of the artists they support.

      The logo combines a circle symbolizing openness and community with a bold, off-center mark that conveys authenticity and difference. A friendly, organic type system balances legibility with human character. The refreshed color palette preserves the recognizable turquoise and orange while introducing yellow and pastel pink to inject lightness and optimism. Supporting patterns, inspired by recurring motifs in artists’ works—spirals, eyes, butterflies—add depth and flexibility to the identity. Together, these elements form a system that feels professional yet approachable, able to live across digital, print, campaigns, and everyday touchpoints like coffee cups.
